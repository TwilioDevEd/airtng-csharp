      ## Workflow Automation - Vacation Rental example

      ![Airtng](http://howtodocs.s3.amazonaws.com/airtng-screen.png)

      At its core this use-case is about enabling your service providers
      (agents, hosts, customer service reps, administrators, etc) to better
      serve their customers. To illustrate a very real-world example of this
      use-case we will implement a webapp for finding and booking vacation
      properties--we're calling it Airtng. Here's how it works:

      1. A host creates a vacation property
      2. A guest requests a reservation on that property
      3. The host receives an SMS notifying them of the recent reservation request. The host can either Accept or Reject the reservation.
      4. The guest is notified that their reservation was either accepted or rejected.

      ## Building Blocks

      We'll be using the Twilio REST API to implement this use-case:

      * [Messages Resource](//www.twilio.com/docs/api/rest/sending-messages): We
      will use Twilio directly to send our users messages at important
      junctures.

    :markdown
      ## Authentication

      For this use case to work we have to handle authentication. We will
      rely on _ASP.NET Identity_ for this purpose.

      Each `User` will need to have a `phone_number` that will be required to
      send sms notifications.

  .step(data-title='Vacation Property', data-file='AirTNG.Web/Models/VacationProperty.cs', data-highlight='6-15')
    :markdown
      ## Vacation Property

      The first thing we need to do is create the property listings.

      The `VacationProperty` belongs to the `User` who created it (we'll call
      this user the _host_ from this point on) and contains only two properties: a
      `Description` and an `ImageUrl`.

      A `VacationProperty` can have many `Reservations`.

  .step(data-title='Reservation', data-file='AirTNG.Web/Models/Reservation.cs', data-highlight='6-17')
    :markdown
      ## Reservation

      The `Reservation` model is at the center of the workflow for this
      application.

      It is responsible for keeping track of:

      * The `VacationProperty` it is associated with.
      * The `User` who owns that vacation property (the host). Through this
      property the user will have access to its phone number.
      * The `Status` of the reservation

  .step(data-title="Reservation Creation", data-file='AirTNG.Web/Controllers/ReservationsController.cs', data-highlight='55-79')
    :markdown
      ## Reservation Creation

      The reservation creation form holds only one field, the message that will
      be sent to the _host_ when one of his properties is reserved. The rest
      of the information needed to create a reservation is taken from the
      vacation property itself.

      A reservation is created with a default status
      `ReservationStatus.Pending`. When the _host_ replies with an `accept`
      or `reject` response the application knows which reservation the _host_
      is referring to.

      In the next step we'll take a look at how the SMS notification is sent to
      the host when a reservation is created.

    :markdown
      ## Notifying The Host

      When a reservation is created, we want to notify the owner of the
      property that someone has made a reservation.

      This is where we use [Twilio C# Helper
      Library](//www.twilio.com/docs/csharp/install) to send a SMS message to
      the _host_, using our [Twilio phone
      number](//www.twilio.com/user/account/phone-numbers/incoming).

      As you can see, sending SMS messages using Twilio is made in only a few lines of
      code. After that we have to wait for the host to send an SMS
      response accepting or rejecting the reservation. That way we can notify the
      guest and host that the reservation information is updated accordingly.

      The next step shows us how to handle and configure the host's SMS response.

  .step(data-title='Handling Incoming Messages', data-file='AirTNG.Web/Controllers/ReservationsController.cs', data-highlight='81-110')
    :markdown
      ## Handling Incoming Messages

      Let's take a closer look at the `Reservations/Handle` controller. This controller
      handles our incoming Twilio request and does three things:

      1. Checks for the guest's pending reservation.
      2. Updates the status of the reservation.
      3. Responds to the host and sends notification to the guest.

  .step(data-title='Incoming Twilio Request', data-file='AirTNG.Web/Controllers/ReservationsController.cs', data-highlight='82-111')
    :markdown
      ## Incoming Twilio Request

      In your [Twilio
      number](//www.twilio.com/user/account/phone-numbers/incoming) you must
      setup the sms web hook to call your application's end point in the route
      `Reservations/Handle`. Remember to expose your development machine to
      the outside world using [ngrok](//ngrok.com/). The url for the sms
      web hook on your number should look like this:

      ```
      http://<subdomain>.ngrok.io/Reservations/Handle
      ```

      An incoming request from Twilio comes with some helpful
      [parameters](//www.twilio.com/docs/api/twiml/sms/twilio_request#request-parameters).
      These include the `from` phone number and the message `body`.

      We'll use the `from` parameter to look for the host and check if he/she has any
      pending reservations. If he/she does, we'll use the message body to check if
      he/she accepted or rejected the reservation.

      In the last step, we'll use [Twilio's
      TwiML](//github.com/twilio/twilio-csharp/wiki/Twilio.Api#smsmessage-sendmessage-from-to-body)
      as a response to Twilio's server instructing it to send an SMS message to
      the _guest_.

  .step(data-title='TwiML Response', data-file='AirTNG.Web/Controllers/ReservationsController.cs', data-highlight='112-118')
    :markdown
      ## TwiML Response

      After updating the reservation status, we must notify the _host_ that he/she
      has successfully confirmed or rejected the reservation. We also have to notify
      if there are no pending reservations. We will send an SMS notifying this.

      If the reservation is _confirmed_ or _rejected_ we send an
      additional SMS to the guest to inform the decision the host made
      regarding the request made for that property reservation.

      We use the verb [Message](//www.twilio.com/docs/api/twiml/sms/message)
      from TwiML to instruct Twilio's server that it should send the SMS
      messages.

      ## Where to Next?

      Congrats! You just learned how to automate your workflow with Twilio SMS.

      To improve this use case you could add anonymous communications so that the
      host and guest could communicate through a private shared Twilio phone number.
