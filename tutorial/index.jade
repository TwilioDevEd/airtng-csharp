      ## Workflow Automation - Vacation Rental example

      ![Airtng](http://howtodocs.s3.amazonaws.com/airtng-screen.png)

      At its core this use-case is about enabling your service providers
      (agents, hosts, customer service reps, administrators, etc) to better
      serve their customer. To illustrate a very real-world example of this
      use-case we will implement a webapp for finding and booking vacation
      properties--we're calling it Airtng. Here's how it works:

      1. A host creates a vacation property
      2. A guest requests a reservation on that property
      3. The host receives an SMS notifying them of the recent reservation request. The host can either Accept or Reject the reservation.
      4. The guest is notified that their reservation was either accepted or rejected.

      ## Building Blocks

      We'll be using the Twilio REST API to implement this use-case:

      * [Messages Resource](//www.twilio.com/docs/api/rest/sending-messages): We
      will use Twilio directly to send our users messages at important
      junctures.
